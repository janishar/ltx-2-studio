## Memory / perf opt-ins (cross-pipeline)

| Flag / env var | Default | Effect | Supported pipelines |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--low-ram` | off | Block streaming: stream DiT layers from mmap'd safetensors. Peak ≈ 1 block + Gemma. ~75% transformer RAM cut. | `generate` (one-stage / `--two-stage` / `--two-stages-hq`), `a2v`, `keyframe`, `ic-lora`, `hdr-ic-lora` |
| `--no-audio` | off | Skip audio decode + mux; mp4 written with no audio track. Video unchanged (the DiT still produces audio latents jointly; only the audio VAE / vocoder / BWE load + decode are skipped). | `generate` (all variants) |
| `--num-generated-keyframes N` | 0 | Append N generated keyframe slots (single-pixel-frame tokens at evenly spaced interior frames) to stage 1; relaxes temporal compression where motion is fast, +1 latent frame of tokens per slot. LTX 2.5 packs only (refused up front on 2.3). | `generate` (all variants) |
| `--tile-frames N` | 1 | Split video tokens into N temporal tiles. Caps O(N²) attention activations. | `generate` (all variants), `a2v`, `keyframe` |
| `--tile-spatial M` | 1 | Split video tokens into M×M spatial tiles. Total tiles = `tile-frames × M²`. | same as above |
| `--tile-overlap K` | 2 | Token-grid overlap (smoother blend at cost of redundant compute). | when tiling active |
| `--enable-teacache` | off | Timestep-aware residual caching. ~1.46× speedup (Euler) / ~1.78× (HQ). Conservative thresh 0.5. | `generate --two-stage`, `generate --two-stages-hq` |
| `--teacache-thresh F` | 0.5 (Euler) / 1.0 (HQ) | Skip aggressiveness. Higher = more skip = faster but quality risk. | with `--enable-teacache` |
| `--video-decoder {conv,diffusion}` | conv | LTX 2.5 diffusion video decoder (sharper, slower, single tile, size-guarded by `LTX2_DIFFVAE_MAX_TOKENS`). Border numerics follow upstream's default chunked mode. Refused together with `--stepwise-*` previews. On official weights it needs `ltx-2.5-video-vae-bf16.safetensors` in the download. | `generate` (all variants) |
| `LTX2_GEMMA_EVAL_EVERY=N` | 1 (per-layer eval) | Per-layer `mx.eval` cadence in Gemma forward. Keeps each Metal command buffer below the macOS GPU watchdog (~10 s) deadline. Default `1` on all Apple Silicon since PR #3 (M2 Max 64 GB also crashes without it at production resolutions). Set to `0` on Mac Studio / M-series Ultra owners who never see the watchdog crash to recover lazy-graph throughput. | all pipelines (text encoding shared) |
| `LTX2_DIT_EVAL_EVERY=N` | 8 | Flush the DiT block loop every N blocks (splits 48 blocks into 6 command buffers, ~1-2 s each). Same trade-off as `LTX2_GEMMA_EVAL_EVERY`. Set to `0` to disable. | all pipelines (DiT forward shared) |
| `AGX_RELAX_CDM_CTXSTORE_TIMEOUT=1` | unset | **AGX driver knob, not an LTX2 variable — never set automatically.** Relaxes the macOS GPU-watchdog eviction timeout for the process that sets it. Mitigates the macOS 26.x + MLX 0.31.x regression where sustained GPU work is killed with `Impacting Interactivity` while the display is active ([ml-explore/mlx#3267](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/issues/3267)); the CLI prints this guidance when it detects that failure. Trade-off: UI responsiveness may degrade during the run, and on some machines it is not sufficient — running with the display off is the only workaround reported 100% reliable upstream. Unrelated to the ~10 s command-buffer deadline handled by `LTX2_GEMMA_EVAL_EVERY`. | all pipelines (any sustained GPU work) |
| `LTX2_GEMMA_MAX_LENGTH=N` | 1024 | Cap Gemma padded seq_len (last-resort escape hatch). Quality risk: shifts left-padded RoPE positions. | all pipelines |
| `--stepwise-image-output-dir DIR` | off | *(experimental)* Every N steps, decode a window of latent frames from the in-progress prediction and write it as a self-contained animated WebP — seconds of real motion at the current denoise quality. One file per step, written once (never rewritten), so write cost is linear; play them back to back for the whole progression. Keeps the VAE decoder resident through denoising, so it works against `--low-ram`, which warns. Multi-stage pipelines tag files `_s1` / `_s2`. | all generating pipelines |
| `--stepwise-interval N` | 1 | Preview every N denoising steps. The final step is always previewed. | with `--stepwise-image-output-dir` |
| `--stepwise-frames N` | 8 | Latent frames decoded per preview. The VAE upsamples time 8x, so N latent frames yield 8N-7 pixel frames — the default gives 57, ~2.3 s at 25 fps. Cost is linear in this and **independent of clip length**, so previews get proportionally cheaper on longer clips (~7% of a 15-min two-stage run). `1` disables motion and previews a single still. | with `--stepwise-image-output-dir` |
| `--stepwise-frame I` | middle | Latent frame the preview window is centred on. Negative counts from the end. The middle is the default because frame 0 is the clean conditioning image on I2V runs. | with `--stepwise-image-output-dir` |

## Pipeline-specific options

| Pipeline | Specific flags |
|---|---|
| `generate --one-stage` | `--frame-rate` (required), `--stage1-steps` aliased to `num_steps` (default 30), `--cfg-scale` (3.0), `--stg-scale` (0.0), `--image`. No stage2 / TeaCache / distilled-lora flags. Common: `--lora PATH STRENGTH` (incompatible with `--low-ram`), `--enhance-prompt`. |
| `generate --two-stage` | `--frame-rate` (required), `--stage1-steps` (30), `--stage2-steps` (3), `--cfg-scale` (3.0), `--stg-scale` (0.0), `--image`, `--distilled-lora-strength` (1.0), `--enable-teacache`, `--teacache-thresh` |
| `generate --two-stages-hq` | same as two-stage but stage1 default 15 steps, res_2s sampler |
| `generate --distilled` | `--frame-rate` (required), `--stage1-steps` (8 default), `--stage2-steps` (3 default), `--image`. No CFG/STG/TeaCache flags (distilled flow). Same DiT in both stages — no LoRA swap. |
| `a2v` | `--audio` (required), `--image`, `--audio-start`, `--frame-rate` (required), all two-stage flags |
| `keyframe` | `--start` / `--end` (image paths, required), `--frame-rate` (required), all two-stage flags |
| `ic-lora` | `--frame-rate` (required), `--lora PATH STRENGTH` (required, repeatable), `--video-conditioning PATH STRENGTH` (required, repeatable), `--conditioning-strength` (1.0), `--image`, `--skip-stage-2`, `--stage1-steps`, `--stage2-steps` |
| `hdr-ic-lora` | same as `ic-lora`, but `--video-conditioning` is **optional** (omit for pure T2V HDR). Auto-detects HDR transform from LoRA metadata. Outputs `.mp4` SDR + `.hdr.npz` linear HDR fp32 |
| `lipdub` *(experimental)* | `--reference-video PATH` (required, provides visuals + audio), `--lora PATH STRENGTH` (exactly one LipDub IC-LoRA, required), `--reference-strength` (1.0), `--stage1-steps` / `--stage2-steps`. Frame count auto-derived from the reference video metadata (snapped to `8k+1`). Output audio is VAE+vocoder reconstruction — remux original audio for music-fidelity use cases. |
| `retake` | `--video` (required), `--start` / `--end` (latent frame indices, required), `--steps` (30), `--no-regen-audio`, `--cfg-scale`, `--stg-scale` |
| `extend` | `--video` (required), `--extend-frames N` (required), `--direction before|after`, `--steps`, `--cfg-scale`, `--stg-scale` |

## Progress output (stderr)

All CLI progress goes to **stderr** so stdout stays clean for callers that pipe it:

- `[phase] ...` / `[phase] done in X.Ys` brackets the silent stages (Gemma load, prompt encode, DiT load, decoders, decode). Silenced by `--quiet`.
- Each denoising stage prints `[estimate] <stage>: N steps x P passes over V video + A audio tokens = F forwards` **before** its first step (tqdm cannot say anything until iteration 1 completes, which at tens of seconds per step is exactly when a run looks hung), then `[estimate] <stage>: ~T remaining (S s/forward)` after the first computed step (tagged `first step includes warm-up` — kernel compilation and cache warm-up make it an upper bound) and once more after the second, timed on that step alone (tagged `refined`, the number to trust). Nothing after that. Passes per step come from the guider schedule (`cond` always, `uncond` under CFG, `ptb` under STG, `mod` under modality isolation; res_2s doubles them). Multi-stage pipelines print one pair per stage; there is no cross-stage total.
- `retake` / `extend`: the estimate carries `cost follows total clip length, not the regenerated window` — preserved frames are still computed and attended over on every pass, so retaking 1 latent frame of a 10 s clip costs the same as retaking all of it.

## Multishot on LTX-2.5

"Native multishot" is a capability of the 2.5 model, not a pipeline feature: write the shots in order in a single prompt, following [Lightricks' prompting guide](https://docs.ltx.video/open-source-model/usage-guides/prompting-guide). Nothing to enable on this runtime. If the model does not cut where you want, `--segment` (Prompt Relay) gates local prompts to time ranges on top of the global prompt.

## Compatibility notes

- `generate --lora <path>` (one-stage) is **incompatible with `--low-ram`** (LoRA pre-fuse happens before streaming setup). Use `ic-lora` or pre-fuse via mlx-forge.
- `--low-ram` + custom `--distilled-lora-strength` (≠1.0) on two-stage uses bind-time LoRA fusion (slower per step but supports any strength). At strength=1.0, swaps to pre-fused `transformer-distilled.safetensors`.
- TeaCache calibration is sampler-specific (Euler vs res_2s). Don't reuse coefficients across `--two-stage` and `--two-stages-hq`.
- HDR LoRA can be combined with regular IC-LoRA control LoRAs in theory but untested — single HDR LoRA per pipeline is the validated path.
- Modality tiling overhead dominates over memory benefit at default Nv (1650-3168). Use only when targeting 1080p / 8s+ on Mac Studio 64-128 GB; on 32 GB Mac, prefer `--low-ram` alone.
- `generate` requires a mode flag (`--one-stage`, `--two-stage`, `--two-stages-hq`, or `--distilled`). There is **no implicit default** — every pipeline maps 1:1 to an upstream Lightricks/LTX-2 class.
- `generate --one-stage` vs `generate --two-stage`: same dev model + CFG, but `--one-stage` runs **once at the target resolution** (no upscaler dependency, simpler latents for downstream). `--two-stage` runs at half-res then upscales 2× and refines (typically faster overall and better at large targets). Pick `--one-stage` for native res ≤ 480×704 or if you don't trust the upsampler; pick `--two-stage` for everything else.
- `generate --distilled` vs `generate --two-stage`: same half-res + upscale structure, but `--distilled` skips CFG entirely (8 stage 1 steps × 1 forward instead of 30 × 2-4). Fastest mode; quality slightly below the dev+CFG variants.
- `--video-decoder diffusion` (LTX 2.5 packs only, experimental) reproduces upstream's **default** `chunked_eager` stage-5 mode exactly: the neighborhood-attention stage runs on four width slabs with a halo, so the first/last ~20 px of each row are edge-replicated rather than attending over the full volume — identical to upstream's own default-mode output, not a port shortfall. Single tile in v1 (`LTX2_DIFFVAE_MAX_TOKENS` refuses oversized decodes); conv remains the default decoder.
